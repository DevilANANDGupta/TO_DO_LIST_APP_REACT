 [Create React App](https://github.com/DevilANANDGupta/TO_DO_LIST_APP_REACT)

This is a private React application for managing to-do lists.

## Authentication Flow

This application uses a token-based authentication system. The flow is as follows:

1. **User Registration**:
   - Users can create an account by providing a unique username and a secure password.
   - The password is hashed before being stored in the database.

2. **User Login**:
   - Registered users can log in by providing their username and password.
   - Upon successful authentication, the server generates a JWT (JSON Web Token) and sends it back to the client.

3. **Token Storage**:
   - The JWT is securely stored on the client side, typically in the browser's local storage or a secure HTTP cookie.

4. **Authenticated Requests**:
   - For every subsequent request to protected routes , the client includes the JWT in the request headers.

5. **Server Authentication**:
   - The server verifies the JWT to ensure it's valid, has not expired, and matches a user in the database.

6. **Response**:
   - If the token is valid, the server processes the request and sends back the appropriate response.

7. **Logout**:
   - When a user logs out, the JWT is removed from the client side.

## Additional Security Measures

1. **Password Hashing**:
   - User passwords are hashed using a strong cryptographic hashing algorithm before being stored in the database. This ensures that even if the database is compromised, the passwords remain secure.

2. **JWT Expiry**:
   - Tokens have a limited lifespan and expire after a certain period . This reduces the risk associated with stolen tokens.

3. **HTTPS**:
   - The application is served over HTTPS to encrypt data in transit and protect against man-in-the-middle attacks.

4. **Input Validation**:
   - Input from users is thoroughly validated on both the client and server side to prevent injection attacks and other forms of malicious input.

5. **Content Security Policy (CSP)**:
   - A strict CSP is implemented to mitigate the risk of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

6. **Access Control**:
   - Proper access controls are in place to ensure that users can only access their own data and perform actions they are authorized for.

7. **Rate Limiting**:
   - API endpoints are protected with rate limiting to prevent abuse or brute-force attacks.

8. **Error Handling**:
   - Detailed error messages are not exposed to users to avoid leaking sensitive information.

## Running the Application

To run the application, use the following scripts:

- `npm start`: Starts the development server.
- `npm build`: Builds the production-ready application.
- `npm test`: Runs tests.
